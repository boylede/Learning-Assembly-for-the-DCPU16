# Basic Concepts

## Numbers 
### Binary
It is not neccessary to understand binary completely to start out. All that you need to know is that binary is the only way computers think, and that they don't "know" that any data should be interpreted in a specific way other than how the programmer tells them to. 

Binary is merely a way to represent numerical values, so essentially everything that the computer knows boils down to one value or another.

Digits in binary are called bits, and the smallest peice of data the DCPU deals with is 16 bits, which means that a peice of information can be any one of 65,536 values, and nothing else. This piece of data is called a **word**.

Writing sixteen 1's and 0's every time you want to talk about a value would get tedious fast, so programmers often use hexidecimal to represent binary values.

# Basic Concepts

## Numbers 
### Binary
It is not neccessary to understand binary completely to start out. All that you need to know is that binary is the only way computers think, and that they don't "know" that any data should be interpreted in a specific way other than how the programmer tells them to. 

Binary is merely a way to represent numerical values, so essentially everything that the computer knows boils down to one value or another.

Digits in binary are called bits, and the smallest peice of data the DCPU deals with is 16 bits, which means that a peice of information can be any one of 65,536 values, and nothing else. This piece of data is called a **word**.

Writing sixteen 1's and 0's every time you want to talk about a value would get tedious fast, so programmers often use hexidecimal to represent binary values.

### Hexidecimal
Hexidecimal, or simply hex, is a way to write numbers just like binary and decimal. It is used because it is compatible with binary - each hex digit is 4 bits of information. Decimal does not have such a direct comparison.

Hexidecimal digits can be any one of 16 values, represented by the numbers 0-9 and the letters a-f. The hex digit "a" is equivalent to the decimal number 10, b=11, etc, up to f=15. In order to denote that a given number is written in hex, the prefix ```0x``` is used. 

```0x12f4``` is equal to ```4852``` in decimal or ```0001 0010 1111 0100``` in binary.

## Assembly Code

Assembly consists of "simple" computations which are executed one at a time, in order. These are called **instructions**. Each instruction contains an operation and one or two values. 

```
	set a, 12
	add a, 4
	set b, 2
	sub a, b
```

In the example above there are several different instructions shown, using the ```set```, ```add```, and ```sub``` operations. As you can probably guess, ```add``` and ```sub``` perform arithmatic on integers. Set allows you to copy a value to another place, in this example we store two values in two registers, called ```a``` and ```b```. Registers are like little pockets of memory on the processor which can be accessed quickly.


## Machine Code

When you write assembly, like many programming languages, you need to compile it into machine code before the processor can run it. The translation from assembly to machine code is more direct than in other programming languages because each assembly instruction represents an equivalent machine code instruction, and vice-versa. It is a one-to-one translation. 

```
	b401 9402 8c21 0403
```
The above block of machine code, represented in hexadecimal numbers, is equivalent to the assembly code shown before. The machine code is divided into blocks of 4 hexidecimal digits, for human readability. Each block of 4 digits represents one **word**.

Instructions in DCPU-Assembly take up between 1 and 3 **words** each, and in this example each instruction is one **word**. ```b401``` is equivalent to ```set a, 12```.

I have shown you the above block of machine code to illustrate a point, but it is not important for you to know specifically what machine code something translates into.

## Instructions
DCPU assembly differs from an actual assembly language in that the operations are all designed to be easy to understand by humans, whereas actual modern processors have instruction sets that are designed to be written by compilers and are not very human-friendly.

```
	set a, 12
```
The first part of an instruction is the opcode, which represents which operation the processor should be performing. Each operation expects either 1 or 2 values, which represent the data that will be manipluated.

```
	add a, 4
```
The first value is overwritten with the result of the operation. The second value is never altered. Here, 4 is added to the value in the ```a``` register and the result is stored back in the ```a``` register.

```
	set b, 2
	sub a, b
```
Here, ```b``` is loaded with a value and then subtracted from ```a```. As before, the result is stored in ```a``` and ```b``` is left untouched.

## Registers
Registers are little peices of memory on the processor which are used to store values for immediate use. The dcpu has 6+2 general purpose registers and 4 special purpose registers.


###General Purpose Registers:

Because the DCPU is made to be fun and simplified for humans, every register is one word and can be manipulated directly, except ```IA``` which I'll talk about later. Actual CPU achitectures can have differently sized registers which are for specific things, and which are full of little rules and tricks.

```
A, B, C
X, Y, Z
I, J 		; these two are sort of unique, hence 6+2
```

Each of the general purpose registers can be used for any arbitrary usage that the programmer wants to, but ```I``` and ```J``` are unique in that there are two operations which affect them directly.

```sti``` is an opcode which means "set then increment" it is like ```set```, but after it sets the value it will increment the ```i``` and ```j``` registers, even if they weren't used in the operation. Likewise, ```std``` means "set then decrement".

```
sti A, 2 	; sets a to 2 and then increments I and J
std B, 1 	; sets b to 1 and then decrements I and J
```

### PC: Program Counter AKA Instruction Pointer
The special registers have specific uses. The most important to understand at first is ```PC```. This is the program counter, or instruction pointer, and it points to the location in memory where the current instruction is. After each instruction, ```pc``` is automatically incremented by 1 and then the instruction at that location is executed.

### SP: Stack Pointer
Like ```pc```, the stack pointer ```sp``` is used to keep track of a location in memory that the processor uses for other operations. In this case it is part of the stack, which is essentially an area of memory that values can be quickly stored in and retrieved from, but only in sequential order. We'll talk about the stack more later.

### IA: Interrupt Address
This is another pointer which we'll talk about later. Essentially a programmer can define a subroutine which gets run when hardware wants to talk to the DCPU or when another subroutine calls an Interrupt. ```ia``` points to the location in memory where that subroutine starts.

### EX: Excess Register
The exess register is used when a function overflows the 16-bit possible values. This is a very luxurious function of the DCPU because "real" architectures often only have 1 bit for overflow and it is shared between different uses. This provides 16 whole bits of extra information when an operation overflows, making the DCPU-16 almost a 32-bit processor.
